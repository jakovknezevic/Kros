        <h1> Kros system </h1>
        <p>
            The kros system has been created to help teachers with assigning students to races and to also make it easier for people who
            work with results because system that is currently being used in my city is more complicated and requires a group of people to work with it.
            Basically, most of the things people had to do, this system does it automatically and most of the required functions are available through the
            system itself.
